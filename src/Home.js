              <h5><strong>My Journey</strong></h5>
              <p>In the last two years, I have gone from being a fresh out of college graduate to have gained hands-on experience with over eleven different high-growth technology startups. Over the last year, I have fallen in love with programming and have begun taking on Software Development projects at mid-sized startups like <a href='https://igluu.com/'>Igluu</a>. I began my career working as an associate at Table Public Relations, a small firm located downtown San Francisco and now work as a marketing operations manager at Crosspoint Evaluations.</p>
              <h5><strong>Myself</strong></h5>
              <p>In my free time, I will either be running, reading psychology books, hanging at a coffee shop or munching on some pastries. I am personally interested in running, coding, reading, cryptocurrencies, stocks, fashion, marketing, border collies, and good-mood food.</p>
