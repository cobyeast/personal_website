# Personal Website
My own website, made with React, and pure JavaScript. Others include languages like HTML5, SCSS, frameworks like Gatsby, React, and tools like Bootstrap and Spring.

## Overview
Made a website to highlight work exprience, and Frontend skills. I made this while crafting a full product landing page using modern frameworks for Gobii, a real estate application.

## How To Run
Clone this repo, and navigate inside the personal_website directory. After, run the following bash command to init yarn -->>

```bash
yarn
```

This will install all packages from the <code>package-lock.json</code> file. Once all dependecies have been downloaded, run -->>

```bash
yarn run start
```

This command runs the app in development mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
